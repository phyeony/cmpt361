I have referred https://github.com/davidwparker/programmingtil-webgl for various drawings.

I have completed all the requirements and steps.

For e2, the super item is called "SUPER_DOT" in code and displayed in pink circle.

For e3, I made the ghosts follow pacman using the shortest path via djikstra algorithm. Moreover, when ghosts catch pacman when there are less than 20 pellets(dots) left, the score is decreased by 750. Pacman can only earn 50 points when there are less than 30 pellets and 25 points when there are less than 15 pellets. Overall, all these strategies make the game much more challenging.

I have used CSS and HTML for texts when game is paused or over.
